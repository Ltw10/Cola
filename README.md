# Cola
Presentation and Portfolio associated with the Cola development environment. Developed in 2019 to showcase my systems programming portfolio using a fun/goofy premise similar to some enterprise software development I have done in the past

This software collects and compiles images from your favorite subreddits and compresses them, indexes them to save time. This project is not technically intensive 


Necessary steps to begin:
0. Run the install script with sudo -H ./install.sh
1. Confirm the script completes properly :)
