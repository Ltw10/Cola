# Cola
Presentation and Portfolio associated with the Cola development environment. Developed in 2019 to showcase my systems programming portfolio using a fun/goofy premise similar to some enterprise software development I had done during my time at Rawlings.

This software assumes it exists under the current user's home directory. 
The environmental setup script requires root privileges. Su/Root user can run it fine. It will handle all dependencies for you.


Necessary steps to begin:
0. Run the Environment setup script on a debian based system
1. Navigate to the config file in the config folder under the git repository.
2. Point it at any image only subreddit
3. run make
4. run Cola.sh
