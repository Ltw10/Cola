# Cola
Unfinished collection of tools for my Presentation and Portfolio associated with my homebhrew Cola development environment. Developed in 2019 to showcase my systems programming portfolio using a fun/goofy premise similar to some enterprise software development I have done in the past. 

Cola will eventually be interfaced by another group of services "cherry", "vanilla", and "Lime". Each using Cola's image downloading for various purposes. This is to split requirements from the original project and hopefully finish Colas functionality by December 31st. 


#Cola is for downloading images

1. Run the install script ./install.sh in your git directory as the super user. 
2. Navigate to Core and compile Cola with ./Compile.sh, it currently will not allow me to compile it from outside of this directory even as root, if you have a solution
		and would like to be credited, send me a pull request and correct that script, moving it to the Cola main directory. 
3. Navigate to subservices/Zip and compile with ./Compile.sh
